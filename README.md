## Hello! :wave: ## I'm Rajalakshmi Raghu 

A little bit about me. I have done my undergradtuate in B.Tech Information Technology and masters in Data Science, AI and Digital Business. I enjoy working with datas and spend most of my time working across different areas of data science pipeline like collecting data through different sources, exploring data, creating visualization projects, and building end to end machine learning and deep learning models.

The repositories holds some of my personal projects that have done for the past year, where I started my journey as a Data Scientist. Currently the prtojects are binned under two categories.

1. [Data Science Projects](https://github.com/rajalakshmibharath/Data-Science-Projects)

2. [Visualization Projects](https://github.com/rajalakshmibharath/Visualization_Projects)
